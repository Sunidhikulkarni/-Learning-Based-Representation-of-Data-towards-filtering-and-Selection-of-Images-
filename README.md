# -Learning-Based-Representation-of-Data-towards-filtering-and-Selection-of-Images-
Learning-based approach is followed to develop a deep learning model to filter and select the images from crowdsourced data that helps in the better 3D reconstruction of Heritage sites. Intentional blur and unintentional blur images are also considered while filtering which is unique in the project.
